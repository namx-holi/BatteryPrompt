# niceprompt
This makes your terminal prompt look all pretty and rainbow


# Installation
Sorry it's just for a linux terminal but hey you might be able to get it to work on OSx? But just copy the stuff in niceprompt.sh to .bashrc or use that 'source' thing in .bashrc or your profile or whatever? Hey I'm no expert okay


# Usage
If you've added it to .bashrc or made it such that you can actually call niceprompt, use 'niceprompt' to turn it on but with the name of the user you are on. Use 'niceprompt --off' to turn it off, and 'niceprompt AAA ENTER NAME HERE' to turn it on but with your name set as AAA ENTER NAME HERE :weary:

If you want to add extra things into the prompt, just follow the patterns!
